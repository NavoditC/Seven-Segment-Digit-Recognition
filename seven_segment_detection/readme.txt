There are a number of ways which might be used to find out the region containing the readings from the original image. These include the following:

1. Perform manual cropping to find out the region containing the numerals 
2. Use the mouse for finding the region of the image containing the numerals
3. Use contour detection to find the relevant region

One of the approaches is to use contour detection in which the relevant part of the image containing the decimal numerals is detected automatically by means of a computer program. However, due to the poor resolution and quality of the images contour detection does not yield good results.

Manual cropping is a computationally efficient approach and it involves hardcoding the coordinates of the Region of Interest.

The mouse might be used for selecting the appropriate region but in case there are many images then it may become cumbersome for the person in charge of monitoring the readings to select the region for each image with the mouse.
