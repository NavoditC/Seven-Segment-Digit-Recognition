# Seven-Segment-Digit-Recognition
This repository contains the code for the project "Recognition of Seven-Segment Digits using Computer Vision". It involves recognizing decimal numerals from electronic devices which make use of a seven-segment display by leveraging computer vision techniques and image processing operations. This project was done as a part of the course - Computer Vision for Engineers at CMU in Spring 2022.
